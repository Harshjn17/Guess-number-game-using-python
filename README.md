# Guess-number-game-using-python

This is a simple Number Guessing Game built using Python.
The program generates a fixed secret number, and the user keeps guessing until the correct number is entered.
After each guess, the program gives feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
This project helps beginners practice loops, conditions, input/output, and variables.

🧠 Concepts Used
• Variables
• Input and Output
• Data Types
• If-elif-else
• While loop
• Operators

⚙️ How the Game Works

1. A secret number is already stored in the program.
2. The user is asked to guess the number.
3. The program compares the guess with the secret number.
4. Feedback is shown:
"Too high" if the guess is greater
"Too low" if the guess is smaller
"Correct!" if the guess matches
5. The game continues until the correct number is guessed.
6. The total number of attempts is displayed.
